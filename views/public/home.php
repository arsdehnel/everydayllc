					<h4>Cuotadera is...</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>...a network designed specifically FOR woodworkers BY a woodworker</li>
						<li>...an informal place for woodworkers to share stories of their trade</li>
						<li>...a forum to learn from each other and</li>
						<li>...a tool to link together the world of woodworking and allow it's users to find new opportunities</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Well sure, but what does 'cuotadera' mean and why call this smörgåsbord of goodness by that name?</h4>
					<p>Good question!  It actually came from the mashing of a phrase in Spanish: 'cuota de la madera' which literally translated means 'share of the wood.'  We mashed that together and ended up with 'cuotadera' and there we stayed!</p>
